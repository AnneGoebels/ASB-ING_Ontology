# ASB-ING_Ontology for W3id perma link

The ASB-ING Ontology consists of three parts. The Core Ontology contains the main elements and attributes of the original new ASB-ING schema.
Additionally, there are two sub-ontologies representing the key classes of the old and the new ASB-ING Versions. 
The old keys have the prefix "asbkey13" (file: oldkeysW3) and the new keys "asbkey" (file: newkeysW3).
These ontologies can be used to derive Linked Data Versions of SIB-Bauwerke Datasets.
